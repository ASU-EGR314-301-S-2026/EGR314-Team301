Our all terrain rover is designed to move over rough ground and pick up objects such as samples or small tools. By controlling the rover, users can see how different terrains and obstacles affect movement and stability, as well as how carrying objects changes performance. The device allows researchers to experiment with navigation and object handling in real time, making it useful for testing ideas and collecting data in the field.</p> <p>Who is your audience?</p> <p>The intended audience for this device is researchers and field technicians working in scientific labs or outdoor research settings. This includes users who need a reliable system for sample collection or exploration but may not have a background in robotics. The rover is designed to be straightforward to operate, with clear controls and feedback so users can focus on their task rather than the technology itself. Its design prioritizes durability and ease of use to meet the practical needs of real world research environments.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#brainstorming","title":"Brainstorming","text":"Questions Features Descriptions What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?

The tracked base allows the robot to move over rough or uneven terrain, making it useful for exploring areas that may be unsafe or hard to reach. A built-in camera and motion sensors provide real-time visual feedback and detect obstacles, helping the user understand the environment and avoid collisions. Wireless communication allows the robot to receive commands from the controller and send video and sensor information back to the user\u2019s screen. The project is divided among five teammates, with each member responsible for one key feature: one handles wireless communication between the robot and controller, one focuses on the screen and user controls, one manages the sensors and environmental detection, one controls the motors and tracked movement based on user input, and one manages power distribution to keep the system running reliably. Clear on-screen indicators, distance warnings, and a live camera feed make the device easy to use, while a familiar game-style controller helps reduce the learning curve. The rugged tracked design protects the components and improves durability, and only basic instruction is needed to operate the system safely and effectively.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#concept-2","title":"Concept 2","text":"<p>The features highlighted in the concept sketch meet our users' needs. The design has smooth edges for safety. It has an emergency stop button in case of failure. There is a buzzer and LEDs for the rover to communicate with the user. It has a gyroscope and cameras so it can tell where it is and what is around it. The functionality will be split into 5 parts, with 2 people for motor control, 1 person for the steering wheel, 1 person for the hall effect sensor, and 1 person for the temperature sensor. This is all included in the circuits part of the design. The first cue is colors, so the user can clearly see which button to press without having to look for text. The on button will be green, and the off button will be red. There are also LEDs labeled to indicate what is happening inside the robot, and a buzzer in case of an error that will alarm the user. The robot is controlled by a steering wheel with forward and reverse triggers. There is a big stop button that will be a bright yellow with an exclamation point in the center. Finally, there are 2 D-Pads for more control if the user does not want to turn the steering wheel controller. The robot and controller will be made out of durable material, so they will last a long time. The edges of the robot will be smooth, so the user will not get hurt if they get run into by the robot.

The instructions will be accessible through QR codes and written in an effective way.  The charging station is divided into wiring, a protective body, and wheel holders with stoppers that guide the rover into place and hold it securely during charging. Guard reels support safe docking, and a sliding door houses the charging cable. The controller is designed to connect easily and function intuitively, using familiar joysticks, a D-pad, and physical buttons.

The controller for concept 2 is fairly simple, and will be easier to control the rover with than the other options. The various visual indicators and safety additions meant that the concpet would also be safer than the other options for presenting and operating.

Disagreements relating to how to complete assignments, such as formatting, what components to include in the final project, and so on will be decided by a vote, in which the proposal with the most votes will be accepted. If a conflict has been ongoing continuously for a period of two weeks without resolution, or a majority of the team believes an assignment will not be successfully completed, the team members can raise that issue to the professor.</p> <p>If a member of the team is not performing their duties, and attempts have been made by the team to inform and allow the team member to improve, the team may choose to issue a pink slip or raise the issue to the professor. If this is done, communications with the member, edit logs on the github repository, and changes made in google documents should be provided to show an attempt by the team to aid the team member in improving their participation, and the lack of improvement by the team member.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/02-Concept-Genrations/Append-Concepts/","title":"Appendix - Design Concepts","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/02-Concept-Genrations/Append-Concepts/#header","title":"Header","text":"<p>Add text for assignment as needed or delete page!</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/03-Examples-to-Hide/charts/","title":"Charts","text":"<pre><code>graph LR\n  A[Start] --&gt; B{Error?};\n  B --&gt;|Yes| C[Hmm...];\n  C --&gt; D[Debug];\n  D --&gt; B;\n  B ----&gt;|No| E[Yay!];</code></pre> <pre><code>sequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Alice-&gt;&gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\n  loop Healthcheck\n      John-&gt;&gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\n  end\n  Note right of John: Rational thoughts!\n  John--&gt;&gt;Alice: Great!\n  John-&gt;&gt;Bob: How about you?\n  Bob--&gt;&gt;John: Jolly good!</code></pre> <pre><code>stateDiagram-v2\n  state fork_state &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    [*] --&gt; fork_state\n    fork_state --&gt; State2\n    fork_state --&gt; State3\n\n    state join_state &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;\n    State2 --&gt; join_state\n    State3 --&gt; join_state\n    join_state --&gt; State4\n    State4 --&gt; [*]</code></pre>"},{"location":"Appendix/03-Examples-to-Hide/esp-32-table/","title":"ESP32 Table","text":"ESP Info Answer Help Model ?
