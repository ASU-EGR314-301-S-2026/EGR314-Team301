## Exploration Devices
What is the goal of your exploration devices?

The goal of our exploration device is to help support scientific work in environments that are hard or unsafe for people to reach directly. Our all terrain rover is designed to move over rough ground and pick up objects such as samples or small tools. By controlling the rover, users can see how different terrains and obstacles affect movement and stability, as well as how carrying objects changes performance. The device allows researchers to experiment with navigation and object handling in real time, making it useful for testing ideas and collecting data in the field.

Who is your audience?

The intended audience for this device is researchers and field technicians working in scientific labs or outdoor research settings. This includes users who need a reliable system for sample collection or exploration but may not have a background in robotics. The rover is designed to be straightforward to operate, with clear controls and feedback so users can focus on their task rather than the technology itself. Its design prioritizes durability and ease of use to meet the practical needs of real world research environments.
