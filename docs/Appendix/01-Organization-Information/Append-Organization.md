### Communication Procedures

Our team agreed upon using text messaging to communicate about our project. It is expected that we will respond to each other when it is the next convenient time to the person as well as within a reasonable amount of time. The times our team is completely free on Tuesday and Wednesday at 6 & 7 pm in the Library. To remind everyone of meetings, Rylee will send out a text that day or the day before.  

We have decided that Hattie Lee will be the main point of contact with our instructor and will relay information back to us by text message or, if needed, by forwarding the email to all of us.

Our team will meet face-to-face when possible and if needed, virtually. The team's meeting leader will discuss with team members about when to meet and send reminders of when the meeting is the day of the meeting. If a member does not show up to the meeting without notice, we will call and check in with that member.

### Team Coordination & Accountability

All assignments will be submitted to Canvas by our quality control leader, Hattie, and will include team and/or individual GitHub links as required. The team will collaborate during labs and assignments to ensure everyone understands the material and stays aligned, seeking help from teaching assistants and the professor during labs and attending office hours when needed. Feedback will be reviewed and addressed by both individuals and the team to ensure quality work and on-time submissions.

Missed contributions or responsibilities will be noted and discussed as necessary, and team members will hold one another to the expectations outlined in this charter. If a member is underperforming, the team will recognize the issue, create a plan to support improvement, and help them catch up. Continued lack of improvement may result in a pink slip or a meeting with the professor and the team.

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

> List the steps and means of documenting issues that lead to involving the instructor in a "Pink Slip" processor. It is best to be **proactive** in resolving these issues early in the semester!
