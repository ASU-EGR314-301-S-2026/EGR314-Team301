### Communication Procedures

Our team agreed upon using text messaging to communicate about our project. It expected that we will respond to each other when it is the next convienient time to the person as well as within a reasonable amount of time.

We have decided that Hattie Lee will be the main point of contact with our instructor and will relay information back to us by text message or, if needed, by forwarding the email to all of us.


### Meeting Schedule and Coordiation

>Your team should identify common times for meeting every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low
